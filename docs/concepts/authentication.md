# Authentication

> **First time?** You need a Trello API key before authenticating. See [Prerequisites](../getting-started.md#prerequisites-get-your-trello-api-key) for how to create a Power-Up and generate your key.

## Supported Auth Flows

The CLI supports four auth modes:

- `device`: paired via the Trello Connector Power-Up (recommended — no API key setup required)
- `manual`: API key and token stored with `trello auth set`
- `interactive`: API key plus browser login token stored with `trello auth login`
- `env`: credentials supplied through `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN`

There is also a `key_only` state when only an API key has been stored. That state is not enough to run authenticated commands, but it is enough to support later interactive login.

## Commands

Store an API key and token:

```bash
trello auth set --api-key <api-key> --token <token>
```

Store only an API key:

```bash
trello auth set-key --api-key <api-key>
```

Check current auth state:

```bash
trello auth status --pretty
```

Run interactive browser login:

```bash
export TRELLO_API_KEY=<api-key>
trello auth login
```

Clear stored credentials:

```bash
trello auth clear
```

## Storage Behavior

- Stored credentials are written to the OS keyring when available.
- Environment credentials are read from `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN`.
- The CLI uses a fallback chain: keyring first, then environment variables. If the keyring backend is unavailable (see [Headless / No Keyring](#headless--no-keyring-linux-ci-ssh)), the CLI falls back to environment variables.
- Stored credentials are associated with the `default` profile in the current implementation.

## Headless / No Keyring (Linux, CI, SSH)

On Linux the OS keyring is provided by the D-Bus Secret Service
(`org.freedesktop.secrets`), typically backed by gnome-keyring or KDE Wallet.
Headless servers, CI runners, SSH sessions, containers, and minimal desktops
often have no Secret Service running, so keyring storage fails with:

```
The name org.freedesktop.secrets was not provided by any .service files
```

In that environment, skip the keyring entirely and use environment-variable
auth — no `auth login` or `auth set` required:

```bash
export TRELLO_API_KEY=<api-key>
export TRELLO_TOKEN=<token>
trello boards list
```

The CLI automatically falls back to these variables when the keyring backend
is unavailable. `env` is read-only, so `trello auth set` and `trello auth login`
still target the keyring and are not needed in this mode.

## Device Flow Login (Recommended)

When `trello auth login` is run, the CLI first attempts a device flow via the Trello Connector Power-Up:

1. The CLI contacts the pairing service and displays a pairing code (e.g., `WDJB-MJHT`).
2. Enter the code in the CLI Connector Power-Up on any Trello board.
3. Once paired, the CLI receives credentials automatically — no API key or developer setup needed.
4. If the pairing service is unavailable, the CLI falls back to browser-based login.

The device flow is ideal for users who don't want to create a Power-Up in the Trello developer portal.

## Interactive Browser Login

If the device flow is unavailable or not configured, the CLI falls back to browser-based login:

- The CLI opens the Trello authorization URL in a browser.
- It waits for the token callback on `localhost:3007`.
- If the browser cannot be opened automatically, the CLI prints the authorization URL to `stderr`.
- Interactive login needs an API key from `--api-key`, a stored key, or `TRELLO_API_KEY`.

## Auth Status Response

Typical configured response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "configured": true,
    "authMode": "interactive",
    "member": {
      "id": "member-id",
      "username": "username",
      "fullName": "Full Name"
    }
  }
}
```

Typical not configured response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "configured": false,
    "authMode": null,
    "member": null
  }
}
```
